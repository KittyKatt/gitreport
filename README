<p>Okay, so this is what you've gotta do.</p>

<p>First, put the Listener directory into the "plugins" directory in your SupyBot install folder. That'll make it available for loading.
You've gotta edit a few values in the "plugin.py" file (3 to be exact) so that it'll work for you. They're clearly marked.</p>

<p>Next, put the three files in the "hooks" directory into the "hooks" directory in all of the repositories that you want to be reported by the bot.
You'll have to do some minor editing to these as well.</p>

<p>The pysock.py file has the most important edit in it. You've got to edit line 4 of that file to match the local port you specified in the Listener 
plugin.<br />
Open the other two files to see that the other edits in those should be self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Make the post-receive and comparse.sh files executable. And that should be it!</p>

<p>Try pushing to your repository now. ;)</p>
